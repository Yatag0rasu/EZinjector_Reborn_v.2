# EZinjector_Reborn_v.2
EZinjector Reborn v.2 - Injector for Valve games

This injector workaround Vac-hook system, so you can safely inject dll file in games
## Differences from the simple ezinjector reborn
First, this injector has the ability to select any running process on your computer. 
Second, it has an improved workaround against anti-injection by backing up and restoring the first 5 bytes of the NtOpenFile after injection.
## How it works

Run the injector as administrator.

After starting, you need to enter the name of the process, for example "hl2.exe" and then press "Enter".

If you entered everything correctly, then you will need to enter the name of the DLL file and press "Enter".

After successful injection we can close the injector and play safely with cheats!
